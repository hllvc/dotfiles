# Neovim configuration

Neovim config files and plugins with lazy.nvim and native LSP

## How to install?

Clone this repo to `~/.config/nvim` and lazy.nvim will automatically bootstrap and install plugins on first launch:

```
git clone https://github.com/hllvc/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```

Custom snippets are located in the `ultisnips` directory and can be customized as needed.

Optional cleanup:

```
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/images
```

to delete the images directory if not needed.

#### Maybe for some plugins to work additional packages need to be downloaded.
